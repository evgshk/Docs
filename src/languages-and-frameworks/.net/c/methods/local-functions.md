# Local functions

Starting with C\# 7.0, C\# supports _local functions_. Local functions are private methods of a type that are nested in another member. They can only be called from their containing member. Local functions can be declared in and called from:

* Methods, especially iterator methods and async methods
* Constructors
* Property accessors
* Event accessors
* Anonymous methods
* Lambda expressions
* Finalizers
* Other local functions
