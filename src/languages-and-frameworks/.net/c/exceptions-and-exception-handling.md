# Exceptions and Exception Handling

The C\# language's exception handling features help you deal with any unexpected or exceptional situations that occur when a program is running. Exception handling uses the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` keywords to try actions that may not succeed, to handle failures when you decide that it is reasonable to do so, and to clean up resources afterward. Exceptions can be generated by the common language runtime \(CLR\), by the .NET Framework or any third-party libraries, or by application code. Exceptions are created by using the `throw`keyword.
