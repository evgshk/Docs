# Base 64 Encoding

**Base64** is a group of similar [binary-to-text encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding) schemes that represent [binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data) in an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) string format by translating it into a [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific [MIME content transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding). Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. Three 8-bit bytes \(i.e., a total of 24 bits\) can therefore be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.
